                <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
                    somewhere in the real of science and technology. You seem like n intelligent, dedicated researceher, and just
                    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued

                        <li>
                            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
                <p>Yes you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your questions, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
                    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                    <dd>Before the re-introduction of roundabouts in Iceland in 1929, there was an odd tradition of drivers performing a variation of a left-turn (counter-clockwise) shuffle in order to indicate a right-turn (clockwise). </dd>
                    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                    <dd>Just like the robot dance you know and love, but with more ice and windchill.</dd>
